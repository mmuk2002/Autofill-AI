What we have: 
We have a script that will generate a AI response based on two parameters: context, and question. 
We have some basic HTML code that will update our online database based on user input.

What we have to do:
What I'm thinking is, when we click the extension, it shows that same HTML page that we just saw. But additionally, it will have a button called Autofill, which when you click, it will call the Autofill method from our contentScript. 

For making the Autofill method work: 
We can hardcode the question prompt.
